# A Bracket for Mounting the SharpSky Pro Focuser on the Takahashi FSQ106 or FSQ106N

I have made a bracket for mounting the [SharpSky Pro focuser](http://sharpsky.net/)
on my Takahashi FSQ106. This bracket should also work for the FSQ106N.

Two parts are needed for the bracket:

* A modified plate from the SharpSky Pro kit.
* A "FSQ106 mounting plate" that is made from 1/16" thick aluminum
  plate. This is a new part that has to be made.
